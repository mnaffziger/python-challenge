Module 3 python challenge 

For this assignment, I was under a severe time crunch due to starting a new job and other typical "life" situations occuring outside of my control.  Unfortunently I needed to let my commitment to the class slip.

SO... I did heavily consult stack overflow, geek for geeks and the class for help on this assignment.  As such Hoon suggested I utilize the posted solution to expidite my homework submission.  I was please to seee that my original (before checking the solutions) plan/outline to write these scripts was very close to the solutions, so limited copying was needed.  That being said, I have commeted in the script where the solutions guided the finesse of the written code.
